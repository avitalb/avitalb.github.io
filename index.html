I am currently a Data Engineer at <a href="https://secure.actblue.com/">ActBlue</a>, the preeminent small-dollar fundraising platform for progressive political campaigns and nonprofits.
<br><br>
I graduated from <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/">MIT</a> with a Masters of Engineering in Computer Science. My thesis research (<a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/143334">pdf</a>) centered on cybersecurity policy for municipal and
local governments, advised by <a href=https://dusp.mit.edu/faculty/lawrence-susskind>Lawrence Susskind</a> and <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniel-weitzner">Daniel Weitzner</a>. I helped teach <a href="https://internetpolicy.mit.edu/6805/">Foundations of Internet Policy</a> and <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.033/2021/wwwdocs/general.shtml#sched">Computer
Systems Engineering</a>. I also hold undergraduate degrees from MIT in Computer Science and in <a href="https://dusp.mit.edu/">Urban Planning</a>. <br><br>

My technical expertise lies in backend software engineering and data engineering. I feel particularly enthused about working with geographic and civic data, building elegant data pipelines,
and implementing robust engineering, testing, and documentation processes.
I also have a background in technology policy with a focus on privacy and security through the lens of protecting individual rights, as well as interest and background in energy, climate, and transportation policy.<br><br>
I am passionate about using technology to fuel positive change, and I am excited about
engineering and policy opportunities in mission-driven organizations in the private, nonprofit, and public sectors.
<br><br>

I enjoy long-distance hiking, experimental baking, reading (especially memoirs, books about the outdoors, and nonfiction), and spending copious amounts of time walking around and taking public transit.
